## My process

### Built with 

 ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ Semantic structure with accessibility in mind
- **CSS3** â€“ Modern styles with flexbox, grid, and responsive design
- **Google Fonts** â€“ Bai Jamjuree typeface
- **Media Queries** â€“ Adaptive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Mobile-first** workflow
-  **Responsive design** - Mobile & Desktop

 âœ¨ Features

 ## âœ… HTML Highlights

- `picture` element used for responsive background images
- Clear sectioning for each major part of the page (`showcase`, `features`, `workflow`, etc.)
- Clean use of `ul` lists and semantic tags (`section`, `article`, `footer`)

 ## ðŸŽ¨ CSS Highlights

- Custom **buttons** with shadows, color schemes (green & blue), and hover effects
- Responsive **grid and flex layouts**
- Adaptive spacing and typography using media queries:
  - `768px`: Tablet layout adjustments
  - `1024px`: Desktop enhancements (grid layout, larger fonts, positioned images)
- Mobile-first design: Starts simple, scales up for larger screens
- Hover effect for footer social icons using color filters

 ## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

- **Mobile (default)**:
  - Vertical stacking of buttons, logos, and features
- **Tablet and Desktop**:
  - Multi-column grid layouts
  - Centered and aligned content
  - Positioned computer image for visual enhancement


### What I learned

This project improved my confidence in responsive design using only CSS Grid and Flexbox. I learned how to:

- Use the `<picture>` element to serve responsive images
- Apply hover effects with subtle transitions for better UI feedback
- Create a fully responsive layout using media queries at 768px and 1024px breakpoints

Example snippet I'm proud of:

```css
footer ul.social-media {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 2rem;
  margin-top: 3rem;
  cursor: pointer;
}

This snippet allowed me to create a clean and responsive social media footer.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

Practice using CSS clamp() and fluid typography

Try integrating a JavaScript clipboard feature to make it interactive

Explore using SASS for better organization and reuse


### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs â€“ CSS Grid â€“ helped me structure responsive sections cleanly.

Frontend Mentor Slack Community â€“ great place to see how others tackled similar layouts.
